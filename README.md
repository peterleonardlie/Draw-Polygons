# Draw-Polygons

One of the more challenging and interesting project that is done in UNSW Master Degree Course COMP9021

The task in this project is to extract and analyse the various characteristics of (simple) polygons, their contours being coded and stored in a file, and

– either display those characteristics: perimeter, area, convexity, number of rotations that keep the polygon invariant, and depth (the length of the longest chain of enclosing polygons)

– or output some Latex code, to be stored in a file, from which a pictorial representation of the polygons can be produced, coloured in a way which is proportional to their area.

for instance, given the input as:
![Home](img/input.png)

the program is required to output a pictorial representation of the polygons:
![Home](img/output.png)

There are many more samples of acceptable and not acceptable input
